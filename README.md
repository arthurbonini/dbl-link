## Part A

##### This is an implementation of a generic doubly-linked class

1. Linked list and its nodes are implemented using C++ templates
2. The list must be generic  (arithmetic/logic functions implemented in Part B)
4. Required functions
  - [ ] destructor
  - [ ] copy constructor
  - [ ] `prepend(x item)`
  - [ ] `append(x item)`
  - [ ] `getLength()` of list
5. Provide an iterator-based interface for the user from
  - [ ] front to back
  - [ ] back to front
